## 👋🏼 Hi, I’m Lucia!

*Cognitive Science major @ UCLA*

I’m passionate about the intersection of education, technology, and cognitive science. I’m primarily curious for how humans learn and how to make that learning stick. I used to think I’d help people through medicine or law, but somewhere between my psych classes and late-night Duolingo streaks (140 days strong), I realized my true interest is in learning itself. 

Now, I’m diving headfirst into EdTech, learning design, and the science behind memory, attention, and cognitive load. I’ve worked in research labs investigating how people remember (or forget) information, and I’m planning on further exploring how curriculum design can reduce burnout and boost long-term learning. 

TL;DR?

I want to build tools that help people learn better without frying their brains. Check out my portfolio luciainthelab to get a better idea on the projects I've been working on!

When I’m not investigating how we store semantic memories or redesigning slide decks for fun, you can catch me figuring out how to finance new hobbies, drinking obscene amounts of boba, or watching the Great British Baking Show.
