## 👋🏼 Hi, I’m Lucia!

*Cognitive Science major @ UCLA*

I’m passionate about the intersection of education, technology, and cognitive science. I’m primarily curious for how humans learn and how to make that learning stick. I used to think I’d help people through medicine or law, but somewhere between my psych classes and late-night Duolingo streaks (140 days strong), I realized my true interest is in learning itself.
